# Todo App

Todo list CRUD app using `Angular 14` and `NgRx 14`.
This app combines Angular for UI and NgRx for state management. Angular brings structure and efficiency, while NgRx handles state in a scalable way.

Actions, reducers, and the store in NgRx drive this Todo list's state.

`Actions` trigger changes, `Reducers` manage transitions, and `store` maintains a single source of truth.
